# Potree 3D Viewer: Massive Point Clouds

**Potree** is a WebGL-based viewer for massive point cloud datasets. It can render billions of points in the browser with high performance.

## Why use this?
- **Lidar Visualization**: View LAS/LAZ files from drone surveys or aerial scans.
- **Measurements**: Perform precise measurements (distance, height, area, volume) directly in the 3D view.
- **No Plugins**: Runs in any modern browser without installing software.

## Usage
- **Data**: Place your converted point cloud data (using [PotreeConverter](https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter)) into the data volume.
- **Customization**: Edit the HTML file to point to your new cloud `cloud.js`.
