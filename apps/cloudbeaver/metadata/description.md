# CloudBeaver: Lightweight Database Client

**CloudBeaver** is a web-based database management tool that supports PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, and more. It is lighter/faster than pgAdmin and very user-friendly.

## Why use this?
- **Unified Interface**: Manage all your different databases (not just Postgres) from one screen.
- **Data Viewer**: Excellent grid view for editing data rows inline.
- **SQL Editor**: Auto-complete and formatting for SQL scripts.
- **No Install**: Runs entirely in the browser, great for quick checks on tablet or mobile.

## Quick Start
- **Login**: Log in with the `cbadmin` credentials you set.
- **Connect**: Create a new connection to `gis-postgres` (Port 5432).
