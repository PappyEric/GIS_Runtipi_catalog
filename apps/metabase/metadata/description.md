# Metabase

Metabase is an open source business intelligence tool. It lets you ask questions about your data and displays answers in formats that make sense, whether that’s a bar graph or a detailed table.

## Data Storage
Uses the internal H2 database for its own settings by default, but connects to `gis-postgres` for analytics.
